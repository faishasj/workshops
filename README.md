# Workshops
This repository contains slides, notes and other resources for workshops that I have run for your viewing/learning/teaching pleasure.

The subdirectory for each workshop will contain the workshop slides in both PDF format and PNG format. There will also be a README.md with a summary of the workshop, notes for running the workshop, comments under each slide and links to any extra resources.

Feel free to open any issues or pull requests!
